    DAS asmfile [-o objectfile] [-E errorfile] [-nu]

    DAS is a minimal 68000 assembler designed to assemble the output of DC1

    DAS SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ASSEMBLY PROJECTS, IT IS MEANT SOLELY TO DEAL
    WITH THE OUTPUT FROM THE COMPILER.

				OPTIONS

    -o objfile		specify object file, else uses asmfile.o (after
			removing any trailer after the .)

    -E errorfile	specify file for errors, else stderr is used

    -nu 		specify that the HUNK_UNIT have no name (for
			libraries, to make the library smaller)



    NOTE:
	    Das cannot handle expressions other than simple +,-,*, and /,
	    and only one address label is allowed per expression (i.e.
	    value unknown until link or load)

	    Das does not understand integral types other than decimal and hex.

	    Das does not understand strings 'string'.

	    Das cannot export EQU labels (i.e. ABS references).

	    Das has no macro facilities

				    FEATURES

    Das includes optimization features used by the compiler.  Also, Das can
    handle arbitrary forward referenced REG labels for MOVEM which most
    assemblers cannot.

    Das allows and automatically coagulates multiple occurances of section
    directives of the same name and type.

    Das automatically pads CODE sections with NOPs instead of 0's.  However,
    DS.L will always pad with 0.


    DAS handles the following directives:

	DC		declare data
	DS		declare space / align

	SECTION 	declare a section.  Sections may be repeated to flip
			back and forth between them.  A third argument
			may contain a value to be ORd with the hunk
			type field, usually used to specify special
			hunk flags (i.e. hunk to chip memory, etc...)

	XREF		import a label
	XDEF		export a label
	EQU		declare a constant (must be a numerical constant)
	REG		declare zero or more registers in register list

	PROCSTART	used to determine procedure boundries for A5 check/
	PROCEND 	link/unlk removal.  Also automatically sets optimization
			option to 1 if 0.

    DAS handles the following expressions:

	+, -, *, /, negation.  Only one relocatable label allowed per
	expression. Any number of EQU'd labels allowed, forward or reverse
	referenced.

    Optimization level 0 (default unless PROCSTART exists in file)

	* MOVEM's using 'reg' labels are optimized to either a MOVE or by
	  removing the MOVEM entirely (reg labels that specify no registers).

	* BRANCHES to BRAs are optimized (up to 20 hops)
	* unsized BRANCHES are optimized to byte branches if possible
	* BRANCHES to the next instruction are deleted

    Optimization level 1  (automatic if PROCSTART exists in file)

	* LINK/UNLK within PROCSTART/PROCEND bounds is removed if the link
	  register (currently hardwired to be A5) is never referenced AND if
	  no subroutine calls are made within the procedure (JSR's or BSR's)

	  This allows support of stack backtraces while optimizing most low
	  level routines written in C.	Removal of LINK/UNLK in routines that
	  make other subroutine calls does not yield much of an efficiency
	  boost anyway.

				    PROBLEMS

    DAS Uses an incredible amount of memory due to efficiency considerations
    in the optimization and myself wanting to keep it FAST.

    When specifying DIFFERENTLY NAMED CODE SECTIONS in the SAME ASSEMBLY FILE,
    keep in mind that the code sections are not necessarily near to each other
    in the final link and the linker cannot generate a jump table for
    PC-Relative inter-module calls.  Thus, one section calling another should
    not use PC-Relative unless you *know* your final executable is going to
    be less than 32K *AND* you do not use the -frag option to dlink.

    This is why the startup c.a references the autoinit sections with
    absolute calls instead of PC-relative calls.

			   EFFECTIVE ADDRESS

    Dn	- data register D0-D7
    An	- addr register D0-D7
    .z	- size (.W or .L)
    *s	- 68020 scale (*1, *2, *4, *8)

    bd	- base displacement expression, Usually followed by base
	  displacement size or (A4) to indicate a data-relative
	  relocation.  Example:   xx+4.L  xx.W	 23+xx(A4)

    od	- outer displacement expression, like bd.  Only allowed if an
	  indirection [] is used.
