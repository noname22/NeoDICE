    DCC <options and files>

    NOTE:   new this version, use of single precision IEEE libraries for
    floating point.   Please read the note under the option '-ffp' for
    more information.

    DCC is similar to the UNIX 'cc' command and is the frontend for the
    DICE compiler.  For best performance I strongly suggest that you make
    DCC, DC1, DCPP, DAS, and DLINK resident.  If you do not have enough
    memory to do so you at least want to leave the largest programs, DC1
    and DAS resident.	It is suggested that your machine have at least 1MB
    of memory.	A compile or link can take as much as 400K of run-time
    memory.

    Options may occur anywhere on the command line but MUST occur singly.
    That is, -c -a instead of -ca.  file arguments to options may occur
    with or without an intervening space.  -oFILE and -o FILE are both legal.

    Files ending in .a[sm] are assumed to be assembly files.  Files ending
    in .l[ib] are assumed to be library files.	Files ending in .o[bj] are
    assumed to be object files.  All other files are assumed to be C source
    files.

    Normally DCC compiles all C source files, assembles all .a[sm] files,
    and links the resulting object files with any specified .o files
    together to produce an executable.	The output file may optionally be
    specified with the -o option.  If not specified, a default output
    filename based on the name of the input file is generated.	This
    general action is modified by two options:

	-c	DCC does NOT link, -o specifies the output object file

	-a	DCC does NOT assemble (i.e. leaves the .a file resulting from
		a compile).  -o specifies the output assembly file

	If neither option is given -o specifies the name of the resulting
	executable.

    The default object directory is T: and may be changed with the -O option.
    The default temporary directory is also T: and may be changed with the -T
    option.  IF YOU HAVE LIMITED MEMORY you may have to specify that
    temporary files not be placed in T: either by re-assigning T: or using
    the -T option.  DICE goes much slower if temporary files must be written
    to a floppy or even a hard disk.

    WARNING: .a[sm] files are assembled with DAS, read DAS.DOC if you
    intend to assemble non-DC1 generated assembly.

		------------------- OPTIONS ------------------

    file	File to compile, assemble (.a), and/or link (.o, .lib)

    @file	File containing further list of files, one per line.
		(blank lines and lines beginning with ';' or '#' are
		ignored.  File may NOT contain further options).

    -E file	specify stderr file, any errors are appended to the file
		instead of to stdout.  Useful for batch compiles

    -c		Compile C source files and assemble into OBJECT files
		only (do not link).

    -a		Compile C source files into ASSEMBLY files (do not assemble
		or link).

		Keep in mind the DAS will do further optimizations on the
		assembly file that you see.

    -l0 	Do not link default libraries (dlib:c.lib dlib:amigas.lib
		dlib:auto.lib), or standard startup (dlib:c.o and
		dlib:x.o).

		BEGINNER'S NOTE:    Do not use this option

		This option is used in special circumstances, such as when
		generating .libraries or .devices.

		WARNING: DICE is much more dependant on its startup code
		(c.o and x.o) than other compilers, do not link without
		the startup unless you know what you are doing.

    -l lib	When linking include this library. (space is optional)

		Generally -l is used to include the math library (-lm)
		when formatted floating point *printf()s are required.

		Refer to the section 'MODELS AND LIBRARIES' and 'CREATING
		YOUR OWN LIBRARIES' below for more information on linking
		in custom libraries.

    -2.0	Default amiga.lib is	dlib:amigas20.lib
		Default amiga include path is dinclude:amiga20/

		-2.x where 'x' is the second digit replacing the '0' in the
		above example.	This option is useful when compiling for
		different versions of the operating system.

    -1.3	Like -2.0, but using dlib:amigas13.lib and dinclude:amiga13/

		Again, -1.x may be specified.

    -L0 	remove default library search path, including all explicitly
		specified (-L dir) directories up to this point.

    -L dir	add the specified directory to the library search path.  If
		the object module or library can not be found in the
		current directory, directories specified with -L are
		searched.  -L directories are searched before the default
		library directory (DLIB:), assuming it was not removed
		with -L0 .

		Note that the directory path specified by -L is used to
		search for libraries AND object modules.

		A trailing '/' is optional

    -I0 	remove default include path from search list.  The default
		include path is dinclude: and dinclude:amiga/ (unless
		modified by -1.x and -2.x options)

    -I dir	When compiling scan this include directory (space is
		optional) The specified path takes precedence over defaults
		but defaults are NOT removed.

    -D define[=value]
		Pre-define a symbol

    -U		undefine __STDC__, mc68000, _DCC, and AMIGA.

	BEGINNER'S NOTE:    Do not use any of these options

    -H<outfile>=<hdrfile>

	This option enables precompiled header file generation and
	operation. You may specify any number of -H options.  Example
	usage:

	-Ht:defs.m=defs.h

	When DICE encounters an #include <defs.h> this will cause it to
	first check for the existance of T:DEFS.M ... if T:DEFS.M does
	not exist DICE will generate it from <defs.h>.	if T:DEFS.M
	does exist then DICE will use it directly and ignore <defs.h>

	You must specify the -H option both to have DICE create the
	precompiled header file and to have DICE use the precompiled
	header file.  Normally one makes operation as transparent as
	possible so as not depend on the option existing when porting
	to other enviroments.

	WARNING WARNING WILL ROBINSON!	A precompiled header file contains
	the preprocessed header and preprocessor macros.  These are set in
	stone!	If you modify a #define that would normally effect
	preprocessing of a header file which is precompiled THE EFFECT WILL
	NOT OCCUR.  It is strongly suggested you use precompiled headers
	ONLY with includes that are pretty much unchanging.  For example,
	the commodore includes or otherwise have an appropriate dependancy
	in your DMakefile or make script to delete the precompiled header
	file whenever any of your headers are modified.

	Normally one has a single -H option that enables precompiling of a
	local header file, say DEFS.H, which contains #include's of all
	other header files.  Source modules would then #include <defs.h>

	BEGINNERS'S NOTE:   Do not use this option

    -o file	Specify output executable, object, or assembly file name
		depending on what you are producing.  The space is optional

    -020	generate code for the 68020 and later microprocessors
    -030	generate code for the 68030 and later microprocessors
    -881	generate inline FFP code for the 68881
    -882	generate inline FFP code for the 68882

	BEGINNER'S NOTE:    Do not use any of these options

	These options exist to produce 020 and 030 opcodes, and 881/882
	inline assembly for floating point operations.	They are not
	necessarily implemented yet.  The intent is to implement them
	by V2.06 .

    -md 	small data model (default)      uses A4-relative
    -mD 	large data model		uses absolute-long
    -mc 	small code model (default)      uses PC-relative
    -mC 	large code model		uses absolute-long

	BEGINNER'S NOTE:    Use only -mD if you declare more than
	64KBytes of data.

	These options specify the default data and code model to use.
	The model may be overriden by use of the __near and __far
	type qualifiers (see EXTENSIONS.DOC) on a variable by variable
	basis.

	DICE defaults to the small data and small code model, and is able
	to generate >32KBytes of code using the small code model so you
	should never have to use -mC.  Note that the DICE libraries have
	all been compiled with the small-data model, and certain
	applications may disrupt the base register, A4... in this case
	use of the __geta4 type qualifier should be of use.  If worse
	comes to worse you can recompile a large-data model C.LIB, but
	I suggest you try other solutions first.

    -ms0	(default), only const objects are put into a CODE hunk
    -ms1/-ms	string constants are put into the read-only code hunk
    -ms2	string constants are put into the read-only code hunk AND
		all external const references use NEAR addressing

	BEGINNER'S NOTE:    Use only -ms

	-ms0 turns off -ms1/-ms2 in case you have it in your DCCOPTS
	enviroment variable and want to turn it off.

	Default operation (no -ms1/-ms2) puts 'const' items into a
	read-only CODE hunk.  Locally declared objects are referenced using
	PC-REL while external objects (declared in some other module) are
	referenced using 32-BIT ABSOLUTE addressing.

	-ms will additionally make all string constants, such as "fubar",
	const and referenced via PC-REL.  -ms is an extremely useful option
	when you will never modify any of your string constants because the
	strings are not copied for multiple running instances of the
	program (if resident).

	-ms2 works like -ms1, but in addition forces all external const
	references to use PC-REL addressing INSTEAD of 32-bit absolute
	addressing.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS OPTION, DO NOT USE UNLESS THE
	FINAL CODE SIZE IS LESS THAN 32 KBytes.

	Using -ms along with -r can result in huge savings of memory due to
	the string constants being moved out of the data segment (which
	must be duplicated for each running instance of the program).

	WARNING WARNING.  In all cases if you declare an object as 'const'
	it must be extern'd as 'const' in other modules or incorrect code
	will be generated.  This is true whether you use -ms/S or not.

    -mr 	registered arguments, light
    -mR 	registered arguments, medium
    -mRR	registered arguments, strict

	BEGINNERS NOTE:     either do not use these options or use only -mr
	BEGINNERS NOTE:     see REGARGS.DOC

	These options control the automatic registerization of procedure
	arguments.  Only those prototyped procedures declaring 4 or fewer
	arguments will be registered.  Values are passed in D0/D1/A0/A1
	according to the type of variable and availabilty of registers/

	-mr This option is obsolete

	-mR generates only a single, registered entry point

	-mRR is similar to -mR but extends registerization to indirect
	    function calls (that are fully prototyped).  This is the
	    most dangerous option.

	Note that -mr and -mR assign the normal, nonregistered entry point
	of a function to any indirect function pointers whether they are
	fully prototyped or not (e.g. void (*func)() or void (*func)(int) )

	-mRR assigns either the registered or normal entry point to
	function pointers depending on whether they are prototyped or not
	(and any calls made through these function pointers will use the
	registered args method).

	WARNING:    -mR CANNOT BE USED IF YOU MAKE C.LIB CALLS THAT TAKE
	CALL-BACK FUNCTIONS AS ARGUMENTS.  -mr and -mRR *CAN* be used,
	however with -mRR you must be careful to supply the registered
	entry point.

	WARNING:    AMIGA.LIB ROUTINES THAT TAKE CALL-BACK FUNCTIONS AS
	ARGUMENTS MUST BE GIVEN NON-REGISTERED ENTRY POINTS.  Thus if
	you use -mRR you *must* qualify the procedure or function pointer
	type specification with __stkargs to entire it has a normal
	entry point.

    -mi 	Inline library calls

	Causes DICE to utilize inline library calls instead of library
	tags.  DCC will pass -D__DICE_INLINE to the preprocessor which
	causes inline stuff in <clib/*_protos.h> to be brought in.
	Your programs must #include appropriate prototype headers
	such as:

	#include <clib/exec_protos.h>

	These are Commodore standard prototype files which DICE postpends
	with appropriate inline specifications when the -mi option is
	used.  If the -mi option is not used the prototype files will
	still work as expected but no inline calls will be made.

    -mw <addr>	USED FOR MAKING ROMABLE EXECUTABLES, DO NOT USE TO CREATE
		AMIGA EXECUTABLES

	BEGINNER'S NOTE:    Do not use this option

	This option is another data model, called the ABSOLUTE-WORD data
	model.	Source files compiled with this option generate
	absolute-word data references to access data objects instead of
	A4-relative or absolute-long.  The base of the data segment must be
	specified as decimal, 0octal, or 0xHEX.

	Since absolute-word is used exclusive of A4-relative, the compiler
	will now use A4 for register variables.  You may NOT mix -mw
	modules with small-data models (do NOT use C.LIB, see ROMABLE.DOC)

	The ROMABLE program is usually run on the executable generated by
	DLink to generate a ROM.

    -ma <addr>	USED FOR MAKING ROMABLE EXECUTABLES, DO NOT USE TO CREATE
		AMIGA EXECUTABLES

	BEGINNER'S NOTE:    Do not use this option

	This option specifies to the compiler and linker that the resulting
	code is intended to be relocated to a permanent data address, that
	specified by <addr> in decimal, 0octal, of 0xHEX.

	Unlike -mw, -ma assumes that the data segment can be placed
	anywhere.  The ROMABLE program is usually run on the executable
	generated by DLink to generate a ROM.

	You may still specify a data model, -md or -mD, to use with this
	option.  Unlike -mw, -ma does NOT touch the A4 register and thus
	may be mixed with the small-data model.  Again, see ROMABLE.DOC

    -rom	SET UP OPTIONS FOR GENERATING ROMABLE CODE

	BEGINNER'S NOTE:    Do not use this option

	Like -l0, -rom disables automatic inclusion of a startup file (you
	must specify your own) and libraries.  However, x.o is still
	included to sink any autoinit code.  Your startup code must handle
	the appropriate model and call autoinit code before calling your
	program main

	This option is used to support ROMed firmware, i.e. non-amiga
	executables.  You should never link with C.LIB.  Instead, a new
	library, ROM.LIB, is available.

	ROM.LIB contains no static or global references and thus works
	with any data model, and only completely self-contained routines
	are included.  The only data ROM.LIB uses is stack-based.  All
	ROM.LIB routines are completely reentrant, including
	[v]sprintf() !

    -proto	PROTOTYPE CHECKING AND OPTIMIZATIONS

	When this option is used, an ERROR message will be generated for
	any call that is not prototyped.  This option is useful to ensure
	that you have properly prototyped routines (when you use
	prototypes), especially when floats and doubles are passed and
	indirect function pointers are used (they must be prototyped as
	well!).

	IN THE FUTURE THIS WILL ENABLE STACK-ARGUMENT OPTIMIZATION.
	Currently, chars and shorts are extended to long's when pushed onto
	the stack for a subroutine call.  In the future if the -proto
	option is used these objects will be pushed as shorts and not
	extended.

    -prof	enable profiling for source modules
    -prof1	same as -prof
    -prof2	enable profiling for source modules and c*p.lib
    -prof3	enable profiling for source mods, c*p.lib, and amiga*p.lib

	Enable profiling.  You may compile some or all your source modules
	with profiling enabled.  Any -prof* option will enable profiling
	for compiled source modules.  -prof2 will cause DCC to link
	with a profiled c*p.lib while -prof3 will cause DCC to link
	with a profiled c*p.lib AND amiga*p.lib (the ultimate).

	To profile c*.lib and/or amiga*.lib functions the equivalent
	c*p.lib and amiga*p.lib must exist.  These libraries are most
	likely lharc'd in DCC2:dlib/ or DCC3:dlib/ but if not, registered
	users may create any link library from the library source.

    -r		Make executable residentable with separate CODE & DATA hunks
    -pr 	Make executable residentable w/ no relocation hunks
    -pi 	Make executable NON-residentable w/ no relocation hunks

	BEGINNER'S NOTE:    Just use -r to get residentable executables and
	do not worry about these other options.

	-pr/-pi generate 'position independant' code also useful for ROMed
	applications.  NOTE that -pi and -pr force const items to be
	referenced pc-relative as well, causing -ms and -mS to do the same
	thing (when combined with -pr/-pi)

	CODE SIZE IS LIMITED TO 32KBYTES WHEN YOU USE -pr OR -pi

	Refer to the section below called 'RESIDENTABILITY' for a
	discussion of these options

	NOTE ROPT1:	You may not make data references within const
	declared objects when using the -r/-pr options.  This is because
	the CODE hunk is shared between running instances of the program
	and these address references would be different between the
	instances.

	However, if you are using the -ms option, string constants will
	be in the code section and thus no problem.

    -O outdir	Specify directory that is to contain output executable,
		object, or assembly files (used when specifying multiple
		source files)

	-O is useful to tell the compiler where to put the objects
	when you use dcc to compile and link a whole bunch of files
	at once.  In this case, the -o option can still be used to
	specify where to put the final executable.

	NOTE:	The -O name is used as a prefix so if you are
	specifying a directory be sure it has a ':' or '/' on
	the end.

    -T tmpdir	Specify the temporary directory used to hold preprocessed
		source files and temporary assembly files... files that
		will be deleted after use.

	NOTE:	The -T name is used as a prefix so if you are
	specifying a directory be sure it has a ':' or '/' on
	the end.

	The default is T: .. this option is useful in low-memory situations
	where you may decide to put intermediate files elsewhere.  Putting
	intermediate files on your HD or floppy slows down compilation by
	an order of magnitude, but if you are running on a system with
	little memory you may not have a choice.

    -s		Include symbolic debugging information in the executable.
		(dlink opion)

	This option includes the symbol table in the resulting executable
	and is passed to dlink.  When using DOBJ to disassemble an
	executable, DOBJ will use the symbol table to generate a more
	symbolic dump.

    -S		ALTERNATE SECTION NAMING OP FOR LIBRARIES

	When making libraries: uses alternate section naming conventions so
	that all initialized data in the module will be placed before any
	initialized data in non -S modules (i.e. normal linked object
	files).  Any library BSS will be placed before non-library BSS.
	Thus, the final ordering in the final executable will be:

	    [LIBDATA] [PROGRAMDATA] [LIBBSS] [PROGRAMBSS]

	Thus, if your program contains >64K Bytes of BSS you can still
	link with a library that tries to reference its own BSS using
	the small-data model.  If your library declares only initialized
	data (i.e. int x = 0; ), then you can link with the library even
	if your program declares >64KBytes of *initialized* data !

    -v		Display commands as DCC executes them.

    -new	Checks timestamps for source/destination and only
		compiles/assembles if object is outdated or does not
		exist.	Used to make DCC a standalone make.

    -f		FAST / ^C HANDLING FOR 1.3

		This option is used for 1.3 only.  You MUST be using the
		commodore shell (NewShell) and if you make programs
		resident you MUST use the commodore C:Resident command.

		This option will probably not work if you use WShell or
		ARPShell under 1.3.  This option allows DICE to take
		short cuts to run sub-programs and allows ^C to be
		propogated to said programs.  This option is useful
		to set permanently in your DCCOPTS ENV: variable if
		you run under 1.3

		DICE under 2.0 has no such problems and will run sub
		programs optimally, including propogation of ^C.

    -frag	FRAGment (linker option).

	Tell linker not to combine all code hunks together or combine all
	data hunks together. Cannot be used if the -r or -mw options are
	used. Generally only useful if the large-data model is used.  Not
	entirely supported yet.

    -ffp	Set fp library for floats
	BEGINNER'S NOTE:    When using single precision floating point
	this option, use of the original ffp libraries, will make the
	program portable across all amigas.  Otherwise only amigas that
	have the commodore MathIeeeSing*.library libraries will be
	able to run the program.

	If not specified, 'mathieeesingtrans.library' and
	'mathieeesingbas.library' are used.  These are new 2.0 libraries
	that may not exist on all machines yet.

	If specified, 'mathtrans.library' is used .. motorola's FFP float
	library.

	NOTE:  IF -ffp is used, be warned that conversion from floats to
	doubles and back again is not entirely reliable.

    -d# 	Set debugging level (# = a number), used for compiler
		diagnostics only.

    -d<opts>	Specify any combination of debugging options.  These options
		may be combined in one -d option.

		Currently no options are defined.

    -gs 	Generate Dynamic Stack Code.  This generates code on every
		subroutine call to check available stack.  If available
		stack falls below 2K a new stack frame is allocated which
		will be deallocated when the subroutine returns.

		If the allocation fails, stack_abort() is called.  If this
		routine is not defined by you, the library stack_abort()
		will call abort().  REFER TO DOC/EXTENSIONS.DOC FOR
		MORE INFO.cd src


		This option is extremely useful when compiling UNIX code
		that expects infinite stack.

    -chip	CHIP force (linker option).

	Tell linker to force all hunks into CHIP memory.  You should
	generally not use this option.	Instead, use the __chip
	keyword (see EXTENSIONS.DOC) for those specific data items
	that need to be in CHIP memory.

	NOTE:	CHIP data items are accessed using the large-data
	model, thus you cannot create residentable executables that
	contain __chip declarations UNLESS THEY ARE ALSO 'const'
	objects -- read-only.

    -unix

	Causes DICE to use DLIB:uc*.lib instead of DLIB:c*.lib	... the
	uc*.lib is exactly the same as the normal c*.lib except that all
	filenames are assumed to be UNIX names .. that is, a beginning
	slash is converted to ':' (root of the current volume), "./" is
	ignored, and "../" is converted to "/" for all file accesses.

	This makes porting and usage of UNIX programs easier.

    -aztec	The front end attempts to run Aztec executables
    -lattice	The front end attempts to run Lattice executables
    -sas	same as -lattice

	These options allow one to write a single DMakefile able to handle
	compilation under any compiler, assuming the source is compilable
	under any compiler.

	These are very limited options and may not work across new
	versions of Aztec or Sas/C

    -//
	This option enables C++ style // comments.  This form of commenting
	begins with a // causing it and the remainder of the line to be
	considered a comment.

    -no-env
	This option disables DCCOPTS.  DCC will not process options in
	the DCCOPTS enviroment variable.


    The ENV:DCCOPTS enviroment variable may contain additional options.

    ENV: must exist for DCC to run, even if you do not have a DCCOPTS
    enviroment variable.  If you do not use ENV: then assign it to RAM:


    Example #1.  Compile hello.c to executable.  The objects will be
		left in T:

    1> dcc hello.c -o ram:hello
    1> ram:hello

    Example #2.  Compile hello.c to executable and put the object file
		in X:

    1> dcc hello.c -o ram:hello -TX:

    Example #3.  Compile hello.c into object into RAM: then link with symbols

    1> dcc -c hello.c -o ram:hello.o
    1> dcc ram:hello.o -o ram:hello -s

    Example #4.  Compile foo.c and link with an already compiled object file
		 gar.o to produce an executable.  foo.o is placed in
		 T:

    1> dcc foo.c gar.o -o ram:foogar

				  PREPROCESSOR

    Predefined Symbols:

	__LINE__	    current line number (integer constant)
	__DATE__	    current date (string)
	__TIME__	    current time (string)
	__FILE__	    current file (string)

	__BASE_FILE__	    base source file (string), allows specification
			    of the actual name of the source file from
			    within an include file.

			    (-U undefines the below symbols)
	__STDC__
	mc68000
	_DCC
	AMIGA
	_FFP_FLOAT	    set if single prec. floats are in FFP format
	_SP_FLOAT	    set if single prec. floats are in IEEE-SING format
			    (default)

    NOTE:  There are no limits to symbol and macro lengths.

			       MODELS AND LIBRARIES

    DICE supports various memory models and this is closely coupled with
    the link libraries it picks.  There are two major memory models that
    effect the link library selection:

	-mRR	    registerized procedure calls
	-md/-mD     small data / large data
	-prof1	    profiled user code
	-prof2	    profiled c.lib
	-prof3	    profiled c.lib and amiga.lib

   Library naming convention works as follows:

	<libraryname>[srpl].lib

	l - large data model	\ one of these two will always be specified
	s - small data model	/
	r - registered arguments, else stack arguments
	p - profiled link library, else not profiled

    Keeping that in mind, these are the libraries that come with the
    registered version of DICE:

	cs.lib		small data
	csr.lib 	small data + registered args
	csp.lib 	small data + profiled
	csrp.lib	small data + registered args + profiled

	ms.lib		small data
	msr.lib 	small data + registered args
	msp.lib 	small data + profiled
	msrp.lib	small data + registered args + profiled

	amigal13.lib	large data amiga.lib for 1.3 (commodore 1.3 amiga.lib)
	amigas13.lib	small data amiga.lib for 1.3
	amigasp13.lib	small data profiled amiga.lib for 1.3

	amigal20.lib	large data amiga.lib for 2.0 (commodore 2.0 amiga.lib)

    Registered users can generate any combination of models they wish by
    compiling the library source code.

    DICE defaults to the small data model ('s' libraries).  Generally you
    will never use the large-data model so these are not included in the
    distribution (i.e. they have to be made).  Since there are a huge
    number of model combinations possible the distribution itself contains
    only those that are likely to be used --- to whit, small data model
    libraries.	DICE has enough features in it that you should never have
    to use the large-data model.

    The large-data model suffix 'l' is new.  This was added to ensure that
    all combinations of models generate at least a one character suffix.
    This allows DICE to give the linker hints about where to find user
    libraries --- if the linker cannot find a library name unadorned it
    will append the suffix and try again.  Previously, the large-data model
    had no suffic so this method would not work (the large data model
    library would be found even though the small-data model library is what
    we wanted).

			  CREATING YOUR OWN LIBRARIES

    It is extremely easy to write your own link library.  There are two
    ways to do it.  First, simply compile various source modules into
    objects and JOIN them together into a .lib.  Second, use the LIBMAKE
    utility (see LIBMAKE.DOC).  You should name the library according to
    the data model, registered args, and profiling capability you
    compiled the source code for.

    For example, if you have compiled your library modules small-data
    without registered arguments and no profiling and want to call your
    library 'foo', you should append an 's' suffix to the library name
    so the actual library file would be called 'foos.lib'.

    If you compiled the library modules small-data with registered args it
    would be called 'foosr.lib'.  If you compiled it small-data with normal
    args and profiling it would be called 'foosp.lib', etc... the ordering
    of suffix characters is always reverse alphabetical.

    When you finally specify your library linking some program with DCC you
    have two choices:	(1) you can specify the full library name such as
    '-lfoosr', or (2) you can specify only the base name and let DICE pick
    the suffixes for you: '-lfoo'.  The latter is the most portable, DICE
    will choose the suffixes according to the various options you give DCC
    when linking.

    WARNING: option (2), just specifying the base name, assumes that you do
    not have a library called 'foo.lib' .. i.e. all your foo libraries have
    at least one suffix character.





		       PUTTING CONST DATA INTO THE CODE SEGMENT

    Two options are available to handle the 'const' keyword: -ms and -mS.  If
    neither are used 'const' is ignored.  The difference between the two
    determines how external references (between modules) are handled.

    With -ms, all string constants "fubar" are placed into the code segment
    and referenced according to the code model (pc-rel or absolute).  Any
    variable declared const will also be put in the code segment and
    referenced similary.  However, any EXTERN'd variables referenced but
    not defined in this module (i.e. defined in another module) will be
    accessed using ABSOLUTE references, since you cannot make a jump table
    for data variables.

    The -mS option is much more dangerous.. it works the same as -ms except
    that external references use pc-relative addressing as well. your final
    executable must be LESS THAN 32KBytes TO ENSURE ALL CODE IS REACHABLE
    VIA PC-RELATIVE ADDRESSING.  If you have a choice, please use -ms
    instead of -mS .

    'const __chip' variables will also be placed in the code section, but
    these always use absolute references since the code section is not
    combined together with other code sections.  You may also override
    default access method (pc-rel/absolute) by using the __near and __far
    keywords, but this is not advised.

    The -ms option affects the main compiler DC1 and can be specified
    independantly for each source module (i.e. some can have it while
    others do not, though normally all will have it one way or the other)

    WHEN YOU USE -pr OR -pi, use of the -ms option is silently forced to
    -mS

				RESIDENTABILITY

    Two options are available to generate residentable executables and one
    option is available to genreate a non-residentable executable with no
    relocation information (loads quickly).

	    RES?   RELOC?   DataLim CodeLim Alloc?  Hunks

    -md     no	   yes	    64K(1)  none    no      DATA, CODE
    -mD     no	   yes	    none    none    no	    DATA, CODE, optionally more
    -r	    yes    yes	    64K     none    yes     DATA, CODE
    -pr     yes    no	    64K     32K     yes     CODE (combined DATA+CODE)
    -pi     no	   no	    64K     32K     no	    CODE (combined DATA+CODE)

    RES:	Can this program be made resident (dlink sets Pure bit)

    RELOC:	Will this executable contain 32-bit relocations?

    DATALIM:	The maximum amount of DATA+BSS that may be declared

		(1) it is possible to declare more then 64KB worth of
		data when using the small-data model by selectively
		making large declarations __far.

    CODELIM:	The maximum size of the CODE

    ALLOC:	Does the startup code allocate a run time DATA+BSS segment?
		(basically, resident programs must, non-resident programs
		do not)

    HUNKS:	Number and type of hunks that may exist in the executable


    -md     default

    -mD     used when final executable contains more than 64KBytes of data

    -r	    most often used option

    -pr     used instead of -r if there is only a little initialized data

	    Can be used with most programs but requires one large chunk of
	    memory instead of the two smaller chunks that -r allocates

	    Also used in ROMable applications

    -pi     used instead of default when there is only a little INITIALIZED+BSS

	    Can be used with many small programs that you do not intend to
	    make residentable, to make them load extremely fast (since there
	    is no relocation information).

	    Also used in ROMable applications

    The __geta4 type qualifier will NOT work with residentable programs.

    You cannot use __far when accessing non-const (see -ms option) data
    in residentable programs

    USING THE -ms OPTION can drastically reduce the amount of data that
    needs to be allocated/copied when a resident program starts up by
    moving string constants into the code section (only the data section is
    duplicated), reducing overhead in both time and space for each
    invocation of the RESIDENT'd program.

    To use one of the options -r, -pi, or -pr specify on the DCC line when
    both compiling and linking your code.  The resulting executable will have
    the pure bit set (for -r and -pr options) and be residentable.

    -r and -pr generate no BSS since the startup code is going to allocate
    the DATA+BSS space.  -pi generates BSS space in the code segment just
    after the initialized data.

    default	uses c.o
    -r		uses c.o
    -pi 	uses c_pi.o
    -pr 	uses c_pr.o
