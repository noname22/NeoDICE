			    MAIN COMPILER PASS

    DC1 cppd_src_file [-o outfile] <options>

    DC1 is the compiler itself.  As input it requires an already
    preprocessed file and as output it produces assembly.  Many assemblers
    will not be able to assemble the output due to forward referenced REG
    labels and the PROCSTART, PROCEND directives.  The output is normally
    fed to DAS which generates the object file

    The compiler generates absolute-data references and absolute code
    references by default.  Do not confuse this with DCC's default, which
    is small-data and small-code.

    The compiler will put argument and auto variables into registers
    according to register availability and usage.  It will use A0-A1/D0-D1
    for register variables whenever possible.  Consequently, the most
    heavily used variables will be in registers even for very large
    subroutines.

    You should get into the habit of using auto declarations within sub
    blocks rather than declare all your autos at the top of the procedure.
    Apart from making the code more modular, this will enable the compiler
    to make better decisions when allocating register variables.

    The output of the compiler generates code of the same order as Aztec or
    Lattice C and, in many cases, makes better choices for register
    variables.	DCC makes much better use of address registers than either
    Aztec or Lattice.  However, it does not do any major contents tracking
    and redundant instructions will be generated.  DAS will handle properly
    optimizing branches and DAS will eventually have a peephole optimizer
    built in it to handle other obvious redundancies.

    The compiler does other optimizations itself, such as using bit
    instructions to handle special cases of &, |, and ^, include using
    BTST.

			   IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

    'volatile' forces a data item NOT to be placed in a register.
    'register' is currently ignored.  'const' is ignored by default
    but will force objects into the code section given the -ms or -mS
    options (see below).  Other type and storage qualifiers are described
    in EXTENSIONS.DOC

				OPTIONS

	-S or -S0   set alternate section names 'libdata' and 'libbss'
	-Sd <name>  set section name for data sections
	-Sb <name>  set section name for bss sections
	-Sc <name>  set section name for code sections

	-SD <name>  set section name for __far data sections
	-SB <name>  set section name for __far bss sections

	    The -S option allows you to modify the default section naming
	    conventions.  DICE uses 'data', 'text', and 'bss' as defaults
	    for the data, code, and bss sections.

	    The DICE c.lib is compiled with -S and the startup code (c.o)
	    references these first to force c.lib's data to come before
	    program data.  The data ordering is then as follows:

		Library Initialized Data
		Program Initialized Data
		Library BSS Space
		Program BSS Space

	    As long as the program does not declare more than 64KBytes of
	    *INITIALIZED* data it can be linked with the small-data model
	    c.lib ..  Thus, large-data-model programs that declare more
	    than 64KBytes of BSS space will still link with the
	    small-data-model c.lib

	    This may be of no consequence because any __far declared data
	    will be placed in a different data segment entirely... simply
	    declare your large arrays as __far and the rest may remain
	    small-data

	-d[#]

	    Set debug mode.  This isn't pretty

	-E file
	    specify stderr file, any errors are appended to the file
	    instead of to stdout.  Useful for batch compiles


	-R

	    Tells the compile to remove (delete) its input file
	    specification when it no longer needs it.  The input file
	    is usually a temporary preprocessor file and DCC will use
	    this option to get DC1 to delete it as soon as possible.

	-proto

	    The main compiler will generate errors for any unprototyped
	    function call.

	-r
	    Resident option.  The main compiler will generate special
	    autoinit code to initialize data-data relocations.	This
	    simplifies the work DLink and the startup module must do to
	    support residentable programs.

	-v

	    Verbose

	-o outfile

	    Specify assembly output file name

	-mc	    small-code model (DCC default)
	-mC	    large-code model (DC1 default)
	-md	    small-data model (DCC default)
	-mD	    large-data model (DC1 default)
	-mw	    absolute-word addressing (overides -md/-mD)
	-ma	    absolute addressing (no effect on DC1 operation)

	    These options specify the memory model.  The small-code model
	    uses PC-relative addressing and the small-data model uses
	    A4-relative addressing

	    -mw is used when making ROMable code and specifies that the
	    ABSOLUTE WORD addressing mode be used instead of either
	    absolute long or A4-relative.   Absolute word addresses are
	    resolved at link time.  THIS OPTION SHOULD NOT BE USED WHEN
	    GENERATING EXECUTABLES MEANT TO RUN ON THE AMIGA.

	-ms0	    (default) 'const' is ignored
	-ms	    string constants and 'const' objs placed in code section
	-mS	    string constants and 'const' objs placed in code section

	    These options control how CONST data items are handled, including
	    string constants such as char *ptr = "abcd";  The default is to
	    ignore the const type qualifier.

	    If -ms is specified string constants and CONST data items are
	    placed in the code section.  Local references to CONST data
	    items use PC-RELATIVE addressing.  Remote references (from other
	    modules) to CONST data items use ABSOLUTE LONG addressing.

	    -mS works the same as -ms but remote references are forced to
	    use PC-RELATIVE addressing.  This can be dangerous and the
	    final CODE size MUST BE LESS THAN 32KBYTES!!!!

	    Usually it is safe to use -ms and, in fact, can save a lot of
	    memory when combined with -r residentable programs because the
	    string constants will not be duplicated for each running
	    instance of the program.
